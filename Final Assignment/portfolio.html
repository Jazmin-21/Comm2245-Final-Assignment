    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Below are some of the projects that I have designed and  written. Starting with the restaurant project I have created a restaurant  flyer, a menu, and a business card. I added a picture of scallops to the flyer  to show what the food at the restaurant looks like. This will also appeal to the  customers because the food is visually appealing. I then added the information about  the business. I added where it is located, the time they are opening, and the  phone number. This is also the same for the business card where I added the  information needed for individuals to locate the restaurant. Since this restaurant  serves seafood I decided to add a blue background and blue font to create an  ocean theme.    </p>

    <h2>Writing Project    </h2>
    <p>Moving onto the writing project. This proposal is based on  dress coding at school. I wrote a proposal about dress coding because I wanted individuals  to become aware of how dress-coding children can become harmful to their mental  health. I also added what it's like for the parents of the children to obtain  proper clothing for their children to wear at school. I was interested in the  dress coding topic because as a kid I saw parents who couldn't buy proper  clothing by school standards because they were expensive. That is why I wanted  to shed some light on this topic.</p>

    <h2>Adobe Designs</h2>
    <p>These are just some of the designs that I created using  Abobe InDesign. I created a shopping bag that has the brand logo. The brand is based  on flower carnations for any occasion. I also created a purple shirt that has  the brand logo. These are items that individuals can get from the brand when  shopping in person. I created a podcast cover art for a new episode that will  be airing. These were very fun to make and I enjoyed the process.</p>
