    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>Throughout my high school years, I was doing dual credit at The University of New Mexico Valencia Campus. Throughout my time  there I was accepted into Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. I later graduated  from the University of New Mexico Valencia Campus with an Associate's degree in  Integrative Studies in 2021. I didn't attend my graduation because that is when  the pandemic hit. The image below is the graduation announcement that the  school posted on YouTube for the class of 2021. Right after I had graduated, I  went straight into The University of New Mexico. I am currently a junior and I  am double majoring in Communication and Journalism English. I have one  more semester to complete before I graduate. </p>
    <p>During my time at The University of New Mexico Valencia  Campus, I explored my writing abilities. I took many writing classes that  interested me. This was to see what I was interested in writing about and what  I didn't like writing. I also was interested in criminology, so I started to  fulfill degree requirements. I later didn't graduate with a criminology degree  because I wanted to move on to learn more about journalism. I only needed one  more class to graduate. As I was attending university, I volunteered a lot  within my community. I've done many different types of volunteer work from volunteering  at the animal shelter to handing out school supplies to children and parents in  need. Maybe in the future, I could complete that class and get the degree. As  of now, I like the path that I am on.</p>
