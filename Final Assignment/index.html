    <h1>Welcome To My Website!</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone, this website has been created on Adobe  Dreamweaver. This website will contain five pages that detail my education  experience, who I am, my projects, and places to reach me. This website has  been created to demonstrate my skills in web design along with projects I have  done. I will also be using this website to upload my future projects. I have  done a lot of writing projects like proposals and multimedia projects throughout  the years. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Out of all the projects that I have done I like writing journalistic  articles about fashion and celebrities. I want this website to hold future  projects whether those are designs or articles that I have written to not only  show the world my creations but to show myself the process that I have made  throughout the years. Creating this website has been super fun yet challenging. <br>
	</p>	
    <p>I have also worked with Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop,  Adobe Bridge, and Adobe Dimension. You will later see some of the designs that  I have that showcase my use of Adobe programs. Below I have an introduction  video detailing a little about my school and the majors that I am completing.  Adding onto the video I have two chihuahua dogs which I love very much. Unfortunately,  I don't have any good photos of them to show here because they move around constantly  while taking pictures. As you explore my website, I hope you get to know more  about me and the direction I am planning to take as I finish my schooling. </p>
