    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Jazmin Molinar. I am a junior at the University of New Mexico. I am double majoring in English and Communication and Journalism with a concentration in Strategic Communication. I have one more semester to complete, and then I will be graduating.</p>
    <p>I love to write, read, and watch movies. Since I have always loved to write and watch movies, I began to be interested in the entertainment realm. That is why I decided to major in journalism. I like reading about celebrity news that includes fashion, music, movies, T.V. shows, and much more. I soon want to work as a journalist and later venture out as a journalist to work in different states. That is a goal of mine that I want to achieve. </p>
    <p>I love writing about fashion trends that are going on, and I also like to research the history behind these trends. Music has been a big thing in my life, and I am always listening to it. I later got interested in who these artists are and how they got into this position. These reasonings are what really motivated me to pursue a career in journalism.</p>
    <p>I chose to major in english because it has always been a subject that I have been good at, so I decided to pursue an english degree as well. I also chose English as a major because I feel that it can help me with more of the technical aspects of writing for the media as a future journalist. </p>
    <p>Once I am done with college, I either want to intern at a company locally to get more experience, or I will jump straight into a journalist job. </p>
